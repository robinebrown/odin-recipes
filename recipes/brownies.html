        <ol><strong>Follow These Steps!</strong>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees (F).</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups sugar, 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour, 2 sticks melted butter, 4 eggs, 1/2 cup cocoa powder, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt until mixed fully.</li>
            <li>Leave mixture aside, and in your baking tray, cover surface with non-stick spray/butter or size and prepare parchment/wax paper.</li>
            <li>Spread brownie batter into prepared baking tray until evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Place baking tray in preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, checking periodically until the top is dry and the edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan.</li>
            <li>Let sit/cool for 20-30 minutes before slicing into squares; the brownie needs time to solidify after baking.</li>
